please run the below m file:
MAIN_CODE_10_2_1d_anesthesia.m

In paramter update, I'm working on L update and is not complete yet. 
Updating of other paramters works well. 

*******************
This code is based on SSCoh_stroop_10_2 that works for nips paper

this code works well to estimate SSCoh for 1d data> real data anethesia
