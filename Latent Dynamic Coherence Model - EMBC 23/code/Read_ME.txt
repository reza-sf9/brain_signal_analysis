-----------------------
Updating parameter is stil under the progress. 
We have 4 different parameters that we try to update them: 
1- sigma    >> variance of state  -x- noise
2- mu       >> ergodic mean of observation -y-
3- W        >> Weight matrix
4- L        >> Eigenvector matrix 
Updating parameters for sigma, mu, and W work well but we are stil working on updating L parameter. 
In the code, you can choose which parameters would you to be updated.
